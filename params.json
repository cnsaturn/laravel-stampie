I personally recommend install [Laravel Buzz Bundle](https://github.com/cnsaturn/laravel-buzz) before we move on.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install this bundle by running the following CLI command:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$php artisan bundle:install stampie\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Bundle Registration\r\n\r\nAdd the following to your application/bundles.php file:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n'stampie' => array(\r\n    'auto' => true,\r\n),\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n* For Postmark, put your Postmark API key in the `config/postmark.php`.\r\n* For other email service providers, create and build your own config file and place it in the `config/` directory. Remember to adjust the [IoC container closure](http://laravel.com/docs/ioc) in the file `start.php` accordingly.\r\n\r\n## Example Usage\r\n\r\nThe following use [Postmark](http://postmarkapp.com/) as the example email provider.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n// Define your message metadata class and put it in wherever you like\r\nclass Message extends \\Stampie\\Message\r\n{\r\n    public function getFrom() { return 'alias@domain.tld'; }\r\n    public function getSubject() { return 'You are trying out Stampie'; }\r\n    public function getText() { return 'So what do you think about it?'; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Resolve your mailer from Laravel Ioc Container\r\n// Here we use postmark as an example\r\n$postmark = IoC::resolve('postmark');\r\n\r\n// Returns Boolean true on success or throws an HttpException for error\r\n// messages not recognized by SendGrid api or ApiException for known errors.\r\n$postmark->send(new Message('hello@yoozi.cn'));\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore infomation about how to use Stampie [can be found here](https://github.com/henrikbjorn/Stampie).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
